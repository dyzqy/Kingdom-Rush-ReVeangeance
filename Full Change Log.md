- L1 fire rate decreased from 0.7s to 1s
- L1 range increased from 300 to 335
- L2 damage increased from 7-14 to 12-16
- L2 fire rate decreased from 0.7s to 0.9s
- L2 range increased from 330 to 370
- L3 cost decreased from 190 to 180

- Crow's Nest damage increased from 1/2 to 6/12
- Crow's Nest deals true damage

**These changes generally serve to move the Shadow Archer toward a long-range generalist role among the Archers.**

### ORC WARRIORS DEN
- Rally range increased from 290 to 350
- Respawn decreased from 12s to 10s
- L1 HP decreased from 60 to 50
- L2 armor increased from 10% to 15%
- L3 armor increased from 15% to 30%
- L3 damage increased from 5-7 to 6-8
- L4 armor increased from 20% to 40%
- L4 damage increased from 9-14 to 10-15
- Bloodlust replaced with Shamanic Blessing
	- Grants 25%/50% magic resist instead of 40%/80% bonus damage

	- Still grants +20% armor
	- Damage buff increased from +5-7 to +11-11 (21-26)
	- Can be applied to 3 Orcs

	- Note: Clicking on tower for stats glitches out when fully upgraded
- Seal of Blood cost increased from 120/120 to 180/180

The Orc Warriors are now more equivalent to the basic barracks in other games, though they trade a bit of armor for increased damage. Arena Champion can also act as a "5th" upgrade tier in case of emergencies. Their magic resistance makes them a much better choice than Dark Knights against mages.

### INFERNAL MAGE
- L1 damage increased from 5-16 to 12-21
- L1 range decreased from 300 to 280
- L2 cost decreased from 180 to 160
- L2 damage increased from 16-49 to 30-50
- L2 range increased from 315 to 320

- L3 damage changed from 33-100 to 55-84
- L3 range increased from 330 to 360
- L4 damage changed from 49-146 to 79-119
- L4 range increased from 350 to 400
- Lava Fissure geyser AoE increased from 60 to 90
- Infernal Portal 
	- Cooldown decreased from 25s to 15s
	- Teleport distance increased from 15 nodes to 30 nodes
	- Max targets decreased from 4/6 to 3/6

As with the other "basic" towers, the Infernal Mage is mostly equivalent to basic mages from other games. However, it trades a slower attack rate for greater damage. 

### ROCKET RIDERS
- L1 damage increased from 7-10 to 8-14
- L1 range increased from 330 to 350
- L1-3 AoE increased from 90 to 100
- L2 damage increased from 20-29 to 22-34
- L2 cost decreased from 210 to 200
- L2 range increased from 350 to 400
- L3 cost decreased from 310 to 275
- L3 range increased from 370 to 450
- L4 damage decreased from 64-92 to 60-88
- L4 cost decreased from 370 to 350
- L4 AoE increased from 100 to 120
- L4 fire rate increased from 2.8s to 3s
- L4 range increased from 390 to 500
- Minefield
	- Cost decreased from 300/300/300 to 200/200/200
	- Cooldown decreased from 10s to 5s
	- Damage decreased from 60/125/190 to 35/70/105
	- Trigger radius/area of affect increased from 50 to 120
- Nitro Boosters
	- Cost changed from 150/150 to 200/100
	- Cooldown decreased to 15s to 9s (every 3rd attack)
	- Damage changed from 100/180 to 90/180
	- Range increased from 500 to 550
- Defective Engines 
	- Cooldown decreased from 22s to 21s (every 7th attack)
	- Damage increased from 22/32 per debris to 50/100 per debris
	- Nodes covered increased from 5 to 10
	- AoE increased from 140 to 160
	- No longer targets flying enemies

Similarly to the Shadow Archers, the Rocket Riders are supposed to fulfill the role of long-range among the artillery towers. Minefield has received much needed buffs, and so has Defective Engines. The Nitro Booster changes are more experimental as a sort of guaranteed damage skill.

### DARK KNIGHTS
- Rally range increased from 290 to 350
- Respawn increased from 8/8/8/10s to 13s
- Attack rate L1-3 increased from 1s to 1.6s
- Soldier number increased from 2 to 3
- L1 HP decreased from 100 to 80
- L1 damage increased from 2-3 to 3-4
- L1 armor increased from 40 to 50
- L2 HP decreased from 130 to 100
- L2 damage increased from 4-10 to 8-12
- L2 armor increased from 50 to 60
- L3 HP decreased from 180 to 130
- L3 damage increased from 7-20 to 15-21
- L3 armor increased from 60 to 70
- L4 cost increased from 260 to 270
- L4 HP decreased from 240 to 180
- L4 armor increased from 75 to 80
- L4 damage changed from 12-36 to 20-35
- Brutal Strike
	- Deals 60/120/180 true (bleed) damage over 3s, with a 10s cooldown
	- No longer instakills
	- Cost reduced from 280/280/280 to 220/220/220
- Armor of Thorns
	- Damage decreased from 15/30/45 to 8/16/24
	- Damage type changed to true
	- Cost increased from 150/150/150 to 200/200/200

Dark Knights now have 3 units, exciting. Their HP has been decreased to accomodate this. Attack rate has also been changed so that they deal more damage with slower attacks. Instakills on barracks are a bad idea (just look at how Sneak Attack ruined Rising Tides), unless you design around them, which really limits design freedom and skews the balance towards fodder only. Armor of Thorns now deals true damage like other versions of spiked armor in the games. 

### MELTING FURNACE
- Renamed to the Blast Furnace
- Stun removed from all levels
- Cooldown decreased from 4s to 3s
- Now deals explosive damage instead of ignoring 75% armor
- L1 cost increased from 120 to 125
- L1 range decreased from 320 to 310
- L2 cost increased from 190 to 220
- L2 range increased from 320 to 340
- L3 damage increased from 25-31 to 27-33
- L3 cost increased from 240 to 320
- L3 range increased from 320 to 370
- L4 damage increased from 41-50 to 42-50
- L4 cost increased from 300 to 400
- L4 range increased from 320 to 400
- Red Hot Coals
	- Cost increased from 140/180 to 200/200
	- Damage increased from 5/8 per tick to 5/10 per tick
	- Coal damage area increased from 40 to 80
	- Note: decal may not match effect radius
	- Range increased from 350 to 400
- Burning Fuel renamed Explosive Fuel
	- Cooldown decreased from 30s to 24s
	- Still doubles attack speed, now to 1.5s
	- Every other attack inflicts a 0.8s stun

In an effort to allocate more of the Furnace's power budget to damage, the stun was removed, in favor of faster attack speed. It also now deals explosive damage, which ignores less armor. Coals was rebalanced around being a mini-Furnace Blast, cheaper, but not as effective. Burning Fuel was mostly changed to fit in with the faster attack speed.

### SPECTRAL MAUSOLEUM
- L1 cost decreased from 110 to 80
- L1 damage increased from 5-8 to 8-13
- L1 range decreased from 350 to 300
- L2 damage increased from 13-20 to 20-31
- L2 range decreased from 350 to 325
- L3 cost increased from 170 to 180
- L3 damage increased from 26-38 to 34-52
- L3 range decreased from 350 to 325
- L4 cost increased from 230 to 240
- L4 damage increased from 48-71 to 50-72
- Gargoyle cost increased from 250/250 to 275/275
- Gargoyle damage decreased from 16-24 to 8-12
- Spectral Communion cost decreased from 300/150 to 160/80
- Possession
	- Cost increased from 200/100/100 to 300/150/150
	- No longer targets max health
	- No longer targets Ghosts or Frozen Souls

The Mausoleum takes the role of the cheap mage, with a relatively weak attack but costing significantly less. Possession was hit with the nerf bat, costing much more and no longer targeting the biggest enemy in a group.

### GOBLIRANGS
- Renamed to Boomerang Goblins
- Boomerang return damage increased from 0.5x to 1x
- L1 damage increased from 3-5 to 3-6
- L1 range decreased from 350 to 300
- L2 damage increased from 7-14 to 8-15
- L2 range decreased from 350 to 330
- L3 damage decreased from 14-26 to 15-26
- L3 range decreased from 350 to 330
- L4 cost increased from 270 to 280
- L4 damage decreased from 25-47 to 23-41
- L4 range increased from 350 to 360
- Biggarangs 
	- Damage increased from 27-49/32-60/43-71 to 60-100/90-150/120-200
	- Slow duration increased from 0.1s to 0.5s
	- Is doubly affected by Headbang's stun chance
	- Is now affected by Advanced Targeting System
- Headbang changed from a 5/10/15% chance to stun for 1.2s to a 15% chance to stun for 0.5/1/1.5s
- Headbang cost increased from 130/130/130 to 150/150/150
- Angry Bees
	- Damage increased from 120/240/345 to 120/240/360
	- Now hits flying
	- Is now affected by Advanced Targeting System

Now actually fulfilling the advertised "two for the price of one", the Boomerang Goblins have lower initial damage, but higher potential from return damage. Biggarangs and Angry Bees have only minor changes. Headbang was changed to make the lower levels feel less bad, as a 5% chance to trigger isn't much.

### BONE FLINGERS
- L1 damage increased from 2-4 to 3-4
- L2 cost decreased from 110 to 100
- L2 damage changed from 5-11 to 6-8
- L2 fire rate increased from 0.6s to 0.5s
- L3 cost decreased from 150 to 140
- L3 damage decreased from 9-20 to 8-12
- L3 fire rate increased from 0.6s to 0.4s
- L4 damage decreased from 14-34 to 9-13
- L4 fire rate increased from 0.6s to 0.3s
- Shortened attack animation
- The Walking Dead
	- Max level changed from 2 to 3
	- Cooldown changed from 16/12s to 12/16/11s
	- Skeleton HP decreased from 80 to 60
	- Skeleton Warrior HP increased from 120 to 200
	- Skeleton Warrior damage increased from 15-25 to 20-40
	- Skeleton Warrior armor increased from 0 to 30
- Got Milk cost increased from 110/110/110 to 140/140/140
- Got Milk damage decreased from +5/+5/+5 to +2/+2/+2
- Bone Golem
	- Max level increased from 1 to 2
	- Max units changed to 1/2
	- Melee damage increased from 17-41 to 25-45
	- Ranged fire rate increased from 1s to 0.6s
	- Ranged damage decreased from 17-31 to 9-18
	- Armor increased from 0% to 20%

Generally speaking, these Flingers fire faster but deal less damage. Got Milk is technically stronger but also costs more, Bone Golem is a bit more effective, and Walking Dead more closely mimics KR1 Skellies. Extra max levels help them not become useless due to not havng enough power per tower spot.

### GRIM CEMETERY
- Now has a rally point
- Generates up to 3 soldiers by default
- Enemies that die in range of the tower are resurrected as a lesser zombie, with 2/3 of the health of the rallyable zombies
	- These lesser zombies decay at 10% of their health per second and are not affected by War Rations
- Removed sideways shuffle for rallyable zombies
- Range increased from 260/260/260/330 to 350
- Attack speed decreased from 1s to 1.5s
- L1 cost increased from 70 to 80
- L1 HP decreased from 85 to 75
- L1 damage increased from 1-2 to 3-4
- L2 cost increased from 110 to 120
- L2 HP decreased from 130 to 105
- L2 damage increased from 2-4 to 5-7
- L3 cost increased from 150 to 160
- L3 HP decreased from 180 to 150
- L3 damage increased from 3-6 to 6-10
- L4 HP decreased from 240 to 210
- L4 damage increased from 4-10 to 8-13
- Cold Grip cast radius increased from 260 to 350
- Cold Grip effect radius increased from 70 to 100
- Zombie-X Muscle Gain renamed Undead Horde
	- No longer increases the HP of zombies
	- Now adds +1 rallyable zombie per level, up to 2
	- Cost decreased from 150 to 125/125
- Bloated Zombies damage changed from 15/60 magic + 27 poison to 30/60 magic + 30 poison
- Explosive Corpses
	- Still only applies to summoned zombies
	- Damage increased from 15/60 to 30/60
	- Poison changed from 27 over 3s to 15/30 over 3s
	- Damage type changed from magic to true for both initial damage and poison
	- Range decreased from 100 to 70
	- Cooldown decreased from 4s to 0s

The tower has been reworked to be much more consistent and reliable, one of its major issues in the original incarnation. It now has a small group of rallyable soldiers, but can still summon more zombies from corpses. These extra summons do have timed life though. This change in turn makes Explosive Corpses actually good. The attack speed increase makes blocking more reliable.

### ELITE HARASSERS
- Renamed to (Corrupt) Sylvan Harassers
- Rally range increased from 350 to 375
- Ranged fire rate increased from 0.9s to 1.4s
- Passive dodge chance increased from 30% to 40%
- L1 damage increased from 5-7 to 5-9
- L2 cost increased from 150 to 160
- L2 HP decreased from 130 to 120
- L2 damage increased from 10-13 to 10-16
- L3 cost increased from 200 to 230
- L3 HP decreased from 180 to 170
- L3 damage decreased from 15-25 to 15-23
- L4 cost increased from 250 to 275
- L4 damage decreased from 25-35 to 20-30
- Backstab dodge gain increased from +10/+10% (50%) to +15%/+15% (70%)
- Backstab damage increased from 10-20/15-30 to 30-40/50-60
- Arrow Storm
	- Cost increased from 140/140/140 to 175/175/175
	- Cooldown decreased from 12s to 10s
	- Arrow quantity decreased from 5 to 4
	- Damage changed from 16-24/32-48/60-72 to 17-21/34-42/51-63
- Fury of the Twilight renamed to Spectral Fury
	- No longer chance based, guaranteed to occur on death
	- HP increased from 250 to 325
	- Damage decreased from 32-48 to 25-35
	- Damage type changed from physical to true
	- Duration increased from 6s to 8s
	- No longer increases respawn

The Harassers remain the damage Barracks, though attempts were made to make the melee mode more appealing. Otherwise, a few changes were made to make them more closely mimic their Origins stats.

### ROTTEN FOREST
- Renamed to Rotten Grove
- All levels deal true damage
- No longer slows bosses
- L1 cost increased from 120 to 130
- L1 slow decreased from 20% to 15%
- L2 cost increased from 140 to 170
- L2 fire rate increased from 0.65s to 0.8s
- L2 range increased from 280 to 300
- L3 cost increased from 190 to 210
- L3 fire rate increased from 0.5s to 0.6s
- L3 range increased from 280 to 320
- L3 slow decreased from 30% to 25%
- L4 cost increased from 220 to 250
- L4 range increased from 280 to 340
- Evil Treants renamed to Tainted Treants
	- HP decreased from 260 to 120
	- Health loss decreased from 25/s to 10/s
	- Damage decreased from 16-24 to 8-12
	- Armor increased from 0% to 80%
	- Cost increased from 200/100 to 250/100
- Roots of Evil 
	- Cost increased from 160/160 to 300/300
	- Max enemies stunned increased from 6 to 8
	- Range increased from 330 to 340
- Mist of Despair
	- Mist of Despair cost increased from 120 to 275
	- New functionality: Enemies within the fog have a 3% chance to run in fear for 3s

Rotten Forest good??? True damage helps the tower actually have an effect, which is pretty cool. Treants now resemble their high-armor counterparts from KR1, though they still lose HP over time because otherwise they will not die. Roots of Evil is a bit closer to WotF now. Mist of Despair's new functionality is nice, and comboes well with the passive slow, active stun, and blockers.

### WICKED SISTERS
- Poison tick changed from 3 ticks over 2.4s to 5 ticks over 1.0s
- Poison cooldown decreased from 2.5s to 2s
- Poison now ignores already poisoned targets
-Stun chance increased from 40% to 100%
-Stun duration decreased from 0.8s to 0.2s
- Stun cooldown decreased from 2.5s to 0.9s
- Attack cast time decreased from 0.733s to 0.433s
- Projectile speed increased from 25 to 45
- Note: The wind-up animation cuts off due to the cast time decrease
- No longer targets first spawned, but targets closest to exit like most towers
- Rally range increased from 250 to 275
- L1 poison damage decreased from 7 to 4
- L1 stun damage decreased from 11-25 to 8-10
- L2 cost increased from 160 to 180
- L2 poison damage decreased from 17 to 9
- L2 stun damage decreased from 27-63 to 19-23
- L2 rally range increased from 275 to 300
- L3 cost increased from 200 to 260
- L3 poison damage decreased from 30 to 14
- L3 stun damage decreased from 48-112 to 34-40
- L3 rally range increased from 275 to 325
- L4 cost increased from 250 to 320
- L4 poison damage decreased from 50 to 19
- L4 stun damage decreased from 78-182 to 48-56
- L4 rally range increased from 325 to 350
- Froggification
	- Cost increased from 230/180 to 325/180
	- Cooldown increased from 22/18 to 25/20
	- Polymorph duration increased from 6s to infinite
	- Is now uninterruptible
	- Targets closest to exit instead of first spawned
	- Animation changed to fire a pink bolt
- Hex Totem now targets silenceable units
- Nimbus 4000 cost increased from 100/100 to 125/125

Wicked Sisters received a ton of changes - not necessarily to make them stronger, but to make them more playable. The cast time is no longer ridiculous, so the witches will actually hit targets before they die. The new stun mode is supposed to offer a sort of multi-target contrast to the single-target poison. Plus, the stun is pretty funny on long attack wind-up enemies like Svell Druids, which get perma-stunned. Froggification is now basically the same as the Sorc's Polymorph.

### ORC SHAMAN
- Renamed to Storm Shaman
- All levels now deal damage in area 100 (Levels I and II) or area 110 (Levels III and IV)
- All levels no longer stun on attack
- Fire rate decreased from 2.3s to 3s
- Note: Decal may not match effect area
- L1 damage changed from 4-20 to 15-20
- L1 range decreased from 370 to 320
- L2 cost increased from 190 to 200
- L2 damage changed from 10-55 to 28-46
- L3 cost increased from 260 to 300
- L3 damage changed from 20-110 to 50-75
- L4 cost increased from 320 to 370
- L4 damage changed from 35-190 to 85-110
- L4 range increased from 370 to 420
- Healing Roots
	- Cooldown increased from 16s to 20s
	- Heal decreased from 1.5/2.5/4 per tick to 1/2/3 per tick
	- Tick time increased from 0.2s to 0.1s
	- Duration increased from 4s to 15s
	- Activation threshold increased from 2 targets at 50% health to 2 targets at 80% health
- Meteor Shower damage increased from 18-33/28-52/35-65 to 30-50/50-70/70-90
- Meteor Shower damage type changed to physical
- Static Shock renamed Shockwave
	- Now only has 1 upgrade level
	- Cost increased from 180 to 225
	- Increases damage area from 110 to 160
	- Decal may not match effect area

Most likely the largest rework in terms of functionality, the Storm Shaman is actually worthwhile, as the game's first magic artillery. Healing Roots is also good, healing a solid amount of health every second, and lasting for a long time. Meteor Shower adds another source of AoE, and Shockwave just improves the basic attack further.

### GOBLIN WAR ZEPPELIN
- Renamed to War Balloon
- Changed attack rate in file from 0.8s to 1.3s, but note that the animation was always 1.3s, so there is no real change
- L1 cost decreased from 160 to 140
- L1 damage increased from 6-12 to 8-13
- L2 cost decreased from 260 to 225
- L2 damage changed from 16-32 to 20-29
- L3 damage changed from 30-60 to 33-48
- L3 attack range increased from 210 to 230
- L4 cost increased from 360 to 375
- L4 damage decreased from 50-100 to 46-69
- L4 attack range increased from 210 to 250
- L4 rally range decreased from 380 to 360
- Paratrooper
	- Cost increased from 160 to 200
	- Damage increased from 18-28 to 30-60
	- Fire rate increased from 1s to 1.4s
	- Damage area increased from 60 to 80
	- Duration increased from 12s to 14s
- Goblin Scout range increased from 300 to 350

A much smoother dps per cost curve for this new version. The Paratrooper is now in line with the Goblin Sapper in KR1.

### BLAZING GEM
- Renamed to the Dark Obelisk
- Fire rate increased from 0.4s to 0.1s
- Range increased from 320 to 340
- Uses a variant attack versus bosses that deals ~45% damage
	- Known bug: Gem of Amplification does not activate versus bosses
- L1 cost increased from 140 to 160
- L1 damage decreased from 2-4 to 1-2
- L2 damage decreased from 6-9 to 2-3
- L3 cost increased from 240 to 270
- L3 damage decreased from 10-16 to 3-4
- L4 cost increased from 300 to 340
- L4 damage decreased from 16-24 to 4-5
- Destructo-Ray
	- Cost increased from 250/200/150 to 500/250/250
	- Cooldown increased from 25/23/20s to 36/32/28s
	- Now targets the highest HP enemy in range
- Unstable Power damage changed from 32-38/63-77 to 30-40/60-80

This tower was changed so that it feels more laser-y. The 0.4s fire rate didn't feel laser-y enough to me. It also was nerfed a little bit at L3/4 as a result, but it's still the DPS tower we know and love/hate. It also has a new attack to use against bosses, because 200 DPS versus any boss is just no. Destructo-Ray got max health targeting, and Unstable Power was really only changed because the numbers felt random.

### DEEP DEVILS' REEF
- Respawn decreased from 12s to 10s
- Bluegale animation changed to fire lightning
- L1 cost increased from 120 to 200
- L1 Greenfin HP increased from 50 to 100

- L4 Redspine ranged damage increased from 9-14 to 60-78
- L4 Redspine ranged fire rate increased from 0.9s to 3.1s
- L4 rally/attack range increased from 290/300 to 380
- L4 damage changed from 40-120 to 75-110
- Chosen of the Sea
	- Max level increased from 1 to 3
	- Adds 0/50/100 hp total
	- Adds 15/15/15 hp regen total
	- Multiplies damage by 1/1.3333/1.6667 (both ranged and melee)

	- Amount of strikes over 5s increased from 3 to 5
- Net Throw
	- Applies to each individual Redspine now
	- No longer makes the target invulnerable (but might glitch visually as a result)
	- Ignores targets that have nets on them already (but still throws at targets that have a net flying towards them that has not hit yet)
	- No longer targets Ghosts and Frozen Souls

Props to anyone who actually read through every change here. The goal of this rework was to make the Reef not a half-measure at Barracks and Mage, but good at both. Of course, you pay a premium for such power, so it is the most expensive tower in any game. Redspine ranged attack was changed to be more similar to KRF. Perfect Storm is now pretty decent, mostly due to the perma-stun it provides for the duration.


[SHAOLIN TEMPLE]
-Range increased from 320 to 380
-Number of monks decreased from 3 to 2
-Attack cooldown increased from 0.8s to 1.2s
-Should no longer continue to attack possessed targets
-L1 damage increased from 2-4 to 4-8
-L1 stun decreased from 0.6s to 0.4s
-L2 damage increased from 5-9 to 10-18
-L2 stun decreased from 0.6s to 0.53s
-L3 damage increased from 9-17 to 18-34
-L3 stun increased from 0.6s to 0.66s
-L4 damage increased from 14-26 to 28-52
-L4 stun increased from 0.6s to 0.8s
-Dragon Warrior
	-HP decreased from 400 to 200
	-Damage type changed to true
	-Respawn time increased from 13s to 15s
-Shaolin Monks (upgrade) replaced with Six-Star Strike
	-Deals 6 instances of 36 true damage in an area of 90 each
	-Each instance applies a stacking 1.36x damage multiplier for 0.66 seconds
	-Cooldown is 30/24/18 seconds
	-Cost is 300/225/225

The Shaolin should be significantly less niche now. Overall, their stun capacity has been decreased to about 66%, but their damage is 33% higher. The Dragon Warrior was too tanky for the price, but now gets true damage in compensation. And best of all, the boring and ineffective Shaolin Monks upgrade was replaced with a cooler active ability.


[SWAMP THING] 
-Melee mode regeneration drastically increased
-Rally range increased from 250 to 300
-Respawn decreased from 20s to 15s
-L1 cost increased from 120 to 140
-L1 ranged damage changed from 19-21 to 17-27
-L1 range decreased from 370 to 360
-L1 HP decreased from 800 to 600
-L1 melee damage decreased from 10-20 to 6-20
-L2 cost increased from 150 to 210
-L2 ranged damage increased from 38-42 to 43-53
-L2 range increased from 430 to 440
-L2 HP decreased from 1500 to 900
-L2 melee damage decreased from 20-40 to 14-35
-L3 cost increased from 210 to 280
-L3 ranged damage increased from 65-71 to 76-86
-L3 range increased from 500 to 520
-L3 HP decreased from 2200 to 1200
-L3 melee damage decreased from 30-80 to 22-55
-L4 cost increased from 290 to 350
-L4 damage increased from 90-100 to 115-125
-L4 HP decreased from 3000 to 1500
-L4 melee damage decreased from 40-100 to 30-75
-Smash!
	-Cost increased from 150/150/150 to 250/150/150
	-No longer grants instakill chance
	-Now deals area damage (in both ranged and melee), and makes every enemy hit deal only 60% of its damage.
	-Damage is 60-90/90-120/120-150
	-Damage area is 120 in ranged and 150 in melee (same as regular melee attack)
-Blinding Liquid 
	-Stun time decreased from 3s to 1.5s
	-Chance decreased from 20/40/60% to 10/20/30% in melee (but still 20/40/60% in ranged)
	-Blinding Liquid no longer gives higher melee damage when it procs
-Carnivore now gives the ranged mode +15% damage

Melee mode has been nerfed quite a bit, because frankly having a 3000 HP allied unit is kinda broken. To counter this, the passive regen was increased dramatically. Smash! is now a weakening ability, as instakill chance based abilities are not great design. Blinding Liquid was already OP so it was nerfed significantly.


----------[HEROES]----------
[GENERAL]
-Hero XP requirement per level decreased significantly, roughly halved across the board
	-Note: For whatever reason, L10 appears to be hardcoded at 400K xp, while this mod puts it at 115.3K. As a result, hero xp bars may glitch out between levels 9 and 10, and L10 will be much harder to achieve than any prior level.
-Hero regeneration tick decreased from 2s to 1s, excluding Tramin and Jun'pai
-Skill costs have changed to reflect the new balance

[VERUK]
-Initial and max armor increased by 6%, from 3% and 30% to 9% and 36%
-Damage increased from 4-11 (+1, +3) [13-38] to 8-11 (+2, +3) [26-38]
-Thirst for War functionality changed 
	-No longer heals 1/2/3 HP every second
	-Now heals 5/10/15 HP/s while in melee combat
-Aimed Slashes now benefits from Duelist
-Brute Force unit cap increased from 5 to 10
-Duelist
	-Tick time changed from 5s to 1s
	-Damage % increase per tick decreased from 8/20/36 to 5/10/15
	-Max stacks increased from 3 to 10
	-Max damage % increase increased from 24/60/108 to 50/100/150
-Inspiring Leader
	-Cooldown decreased from 20/18/15s to 15/13/11s
	-Goblin T1 HP decreased from 50 to 40
	-Goblin damage set to 6-8 at all levels
-Enter the Warmongers
	-Cooldown decreased from 40s to 15s
	-Warmonger HP decreased from 70 (+30) [180] to 70 (+20) [130]
	-Melee and ranged damage set to same value
	-Damage decreased to 6-8 (+2, +3) [12-17]
	-Duration increased from 10s to 15/20/25/30s

Wow Veruk is actually good now! He excels at 2 things - unit spam and dueling. His small Goblins are summoned a lot more often, so it's esay to have them up for any engagement. And his ult is now like a 2nd pair of reinforcements! His innate now heals him significantly, but only in combat, which ties into Duelist now stacking faster so he can make better use of it. 

[ASRA]
-HP decreased from 100 (+20) [280] to 105 (+15) [240]
-Armor decreased from 6 (+1) [15] to 0
-Melee damage changed from 6-9 (+1.22, +1.88) [17-26] to 6-9 (+1, +2) [15-27]
-Ranged damage increased from 7-11 (+1.66, +2.33) [22-32] to 6-10 (+3, +4) [33-46]
-Spider Bite
	-Damage increased from 7/15/35 per tick to 36/72/108 per tick
	-Deals 9-15/12-21/15-27 damage on hit
	-Is now uninterruptible
-Onyx Arrows 
	-Arrows decreased from 3/4/5 to 2/3/4
	-Damage decreased from 20-30/28-42/36-54 to 10-20/20-30/30-40
	-Cooldown decreased from 18s to 10s
	-Damage type changed from magic to true
	-Armor reduction increased from 2/4/6 to 5/10/15 per shot
-Quiver of Sorrow armor break increased from 1/2/3 to 2/4/6

	-Duration decreased from 4s to 3s
	-Cooldown decreased from 22s to 10s
-Toxic Rain
	-Arrows increased from 12 to 18
	-Damage increased from 10/15/30/50 to 26/52/78/104
	-Cooldown increased from 50s to 80s

Asra took a few nerfs so she isn't as jack of all trades as before. She is now more fragile overall, while her shield has less HP (though it does have a lower cooldown). Toxic Rain also has a significant cooldown increase, though it deals more damage. Asra's main buffs are in her Onyx Arrows (much lower cooldown) and armor break, which has been restored to its pre-nerf values.

[OLOCH]
-Changed skills costs to better reflect power levels
-Melee damage increased from 1-3 (+0.77, +1.22) [8-14] to 5-7 (+1, +1) [14-16]
-Ranged damage increased from 4-8 (+2.33, +4.22) [25-46] to 8-15 (+3,+5) [35-60]
-Infernal Combustion damage increased from 50/70/100 to 120/240/360
-Movement speed increased from 55 to 66
-Duplication
	-Duplicates per cast decreased from 2 to 1
	-Duplication cooldown decreased from 25 to 10
	-Duplicate damage changed from 10-20/16-48/24-72 to 14-25/23-40/32-55
	-Duplicate fire rate decreased from 1.6s to 1.8s
	-Is now uninterruptible
-Magma Eruption area increased from 40 to 100
-Magma Eruption is now uninterruptible
-Hellish Infusion
	-Range increased from 300 to 350
	-Duration increased from 6s to 15s
	-Is now uninterruptible
	-Does not trigger while moving
-Demonic Blast
	-Targets the enemy with the highest HP in range
	-Damage increased from 60-180/120-360/180-540 to 120-180/240-360/360-540
	-Is now uninterruptible
-Seal of Isolation cooldown increased from 30/27/24/20s to 30s
-Seal of Isolation now briefly stuns enemies in the slight delay before teleporting, interrupting any abilities they were performing.

Oloch, similarly to Asra, saw a significant nerf to his ultimate in terms of cooldown. Luckily, the rest of his kit received huge buffs to compensate. Duplicates can be used more often, Magma Eruption hits multiple targets, and Demonic Blast will rarely be wasted. Most importantly, he now deals actual damage when he dies.

[MARGOSA]
-Damage increased from 13-20 (+2.33, +3.33) [34-50] to 13-20 (+3, +4) [40-56]
-Bat Familiar damage increased from 3-7/6-14/9-21 to 5-7/10-14/15-21
-Mist of Despair
	-Cooldown decreased from 20s to 20/15/10s
	-Range increased from 40 to 80
	-Damage increased from 2/3/5 to 2/4/6 per tick
-Dark Call
	-Now targets spellcasters exclusively (but still only those that are closer to the exit than her)
	-Afflicts the target with a 2x damage taken debuff for 4/8/8s
	-No longer stuns the target
	-Cooldown reduced from 20s to 15/15/10s
-Vampiric Touch healing increased from 20/30/50% of damage dealt to 20/40/60%
-Beast Form (Pending Rebalance)
	-Beast Form HP increased from 500 to 750
	-Damage increased to 30-45/60-75/90-105/120-135
	-Duration decreased to 5s
	-Cooldown decreased to 15s

Margosa can now hopefully use her other skills more often and more effectively. The intent is to make her into a mage killer, who snipes the spellasters before they become an issue by combining her Dark Call with a quick usage of Beast Form. Her playstyle should no longer be just 'beast form go brr'. 

[MORTEMIS]
-Melee damage increased from 3-5 (+0.77, +1.55) [10-19] to 3-5 (+1,+1) [12-14]
-Ranged damage changed from 5-30 (+1.55, +8.33) [19-105] to 5-30 (+6,8) [59-102]

	-Range increased from 200 to 225
	-Affected enemies now have a green circle at their feet (like Dread Aura, but green instead of purple)
	-Max units increased from 8 to infinite
-Zombie HP increased from 50/110/160 to 70/140/210
-Zombie damage increased from 1-3/3-6/4-8 to 2-4/3-6/4-8
-Rotten Bodyguard
	-Behemoth HP increased from 500/600/650/700 to 500/600/700/800
	-Behemoth damage increased from 5-13/8-25/16-50/25-75 to 5-15/20-35/35-55/50-75
	-Behemoth duration increased from 15s to 24s

Mortemis got a significantly lower damage variance, because high variance is a terrible idea. Otherwise, some minor buffs here and there, with the most notable being to his summons. Regular zombies are much healthier. The Behemoth meanwhile, has improved damage, HP, and duration.

[TRAMIN]
-HP decreased from 150 (+20) [330] to 49 (+14) [175]
-Armor increased from 1 (+2.55) [24] to 10 (+2) [28]

-Boombots
	-Cooldown decreased from 10s to 7s
	-Duration decreased from 60s to 56s
	-Damage increased from 28-52/42-78/56-104 to 28-70/42-105/56-140

	-Rockets increased from 2/4/6 to 3/5/7
	-Damage decreased from 25-46/32-59/39-72 to 21-35/35-49/49-63

	-Area increased to 105
	-XP decreased from 350 to 250

Tramin has been redesigned around being a mad inventor obsessed with the number 7. Hence, nearly everything in his kit is divisble by 7. He did get some QOL changes in the process, such as special explosives not resetting his ranged attack and an actual reasonable basic attack AoE. You can also gamble and play melee Tramin. 

[JIGOU]
-Armor changed from 7 (+1.88) [24] to 6 (+2) [24%]
-Damage decreased from 16-24 (+4.77, +7.22) [59-89] to 16-24 (+3,5) [43-69]
-Respawn increased from 20s to 25s
-Movement speed increased from 42 to 55
-Yeti Blood healing increased from 3/5/6 per tick to 3/5/7 per tick
-Ice Ball
	-Damage increased from 35-65/88-163/158-193 to 55-105/125-195/195-285

	-Slow changed from 15/30/40/60 to 15/30/45/60
	-Area increased to 100

Jigou hasn't received many changes, mostly just the usual reduce variance / fixing non-linear health scaling. His ultimate now damages as a DoT, which is different.

[BERESAD]
-HP decreased from 375 (+25) [600] to 300 (+10) [390]
-Damage changed from 13-23 (+3.11, +5.88) [41-76] to 13-23 (+4,+5) [49-68]
-Damage type changed to true
-Speed decreased from 90 to 60
-Avarice bonus increased from 2 gold to 15 gold
-Skill order changed to Obliterate, Fear the Dragon, Dragon Spawn, Conflagration
-Obliterate
	-Cooldown decreased from 70/60/50s to 50s
	-Area damage increased from 8-12/12-18/18-24 to 50-60/100-120/150-180
	-Range increased from 250 to 350, min range decreased from 100 to 40

	-Cooldown decreased from 45s to 30s
	-Now deals 50 explosive damage in area 90 when the unit spawns

	-Tick time decreased from 0.2s to 0.1s
	-Area increased from 80 to 120
	-Damage decreased from 2/3/5 to 2/3/4
	-Cooldown decreased from 28/26/24s to 24s

	-Cooldown increased from 70s to 90s
	-Burn duration increased from 4s to 6s
	-Damage changed from 1/3/6/9 per tick to 2/4/6/8 per tick

Like all dragons, Beresad has lost a lot of HP. He's also a lot slower. His damage is mildly different but now deals true, which is nice. Avarice, which unfortunately can't apply outside those attacks, at least has a decent reward now. His regular skills, especially Dragon Spawn, have been buffed, which he needed as an ult-dependent hero. Speaking of the ult, it has a longer cooldown and takes longer to deal damage. 

[DOOM TANK]
-HP changed from 220 (+20) [400] to 200 (+30) [470]
-Armor changed from 6 (+6) [60] to 33% (+3%) [60%]

-Damage area increased from 40 to 100
-Range increased to 400
-Spiky Slugs damage increased from 1 per tick to 5 per tick
-Spiky Slugs area increased from 60 to 90
-Ground Slam damage increased from 21-39/42-78/63-117 to 41-59/92-108/143-157
-Ground Slam stun duration increased from 2s to 3s

	-Now have idle heal
	-Ranged expendables will no longer shoot while moving
-Scorching Cannon

	-Damage increased from 2/4/6 to 4/8/12
	-Tick time decreased from 0.2s to 0.1s
	-Cooldown decreased from 35/33/30s to 25s
-Call of the Valkyrie
	-Cooldown increased from 60s to 100s

	-Tick time decreased from 0.2s to 0.1s
	-Damage increased from 2/3/7/12 to 10/20/30/40
	-Damage type changed from physical to true

The Tank's basic attack is now pretty decent and serves as good artillery support. Spiky Slugs is still bad but maybe it'll see some use. Otherwise, some minor damage buffs here and there, especially to Scorching Cannon. Call of the Valkyrie has a much longer cooldown but has been essentially restored to its super strong mobile version. 400 d/s go SHOOM

[JUN'PAI]
-Melee damage decreased from 8-12 (+2.44, +3.55) [30-44] to 8-12 (+2,2) [26-30]
-Ranged damage increased from 8-12 (+2.44, +3.55) [30-44] to 15-25 (+5,5) [60-70]
-Ranged fire rate decreased from 1.1s to 2.5s

-Last Stand
	-Activation decreased from 80% HP to 70% HP
	-Bonus damage decreased from 50% to 30%
	-Now affects allied units within range 120
-Banner of Courage
	-Max allies increased from 8 to 16
	-Range increased from 120 to 120/150/180
	-Cooldown decreased from 12s to 10s

-Tidal Wave is now uninterruptible
-Terror damage reduced from 6/10/20/30 to 6/12/18/24
-Terror now slows by 25%

Jun'pai now has some interesting stuff going on. His Last Stand buff works not only when he is on low health, but when allies are as well, which may be useful. Splash now occurs much more often, and is properly offset to hit more targets. TFTD now slows, which it probably should've done in the first place.

[EISKALT]
-HP decreased from 300 (+25) [525] to 160 (+10) [250]
-Armor decreased from 0% to -25% (takes +25% damage from physical attacks)

-Avalanche cooldown increased from 18s to 24s
-Avalanche damage decreased from 8/16/24 per 0.25s to 5/10/15 per 0.25s

	-Ice Peaks spike range increased from 55 to 60

	-Is now uninterruptible
-Glacial Storm duration changed from 3/4/8/12s to 3/6/9/12s
-Glacial Storm cooldown increased from 50s to 75s

Eiskalt has been whacked over and over with the nerf bat and is only just learning his place. It took halving his health, giving him negative armor, lowering his stats in almost every way, and making Ice Peaks somewhat weaker to get here. And even then he's still really strong. 

[MURGLUN]
-HP decreased from 320 (+25) [545] to 275 (+15) [410]
-Armor changed from 4 (+2) [22] to 20

-Tar Maker damage buff decreased from 5/10/20 to 5/10/15
-Volcanic Barrage damage area increased from 50 to 100 (matches instakill area)

Murglun is probably the least touched of the dragons, with some minor buffs even, wow. True damage, bigger lava pools, infernal heat slows. Pretty nice. May need to nerf further though, she is a dragon after all.

[DIANYUN]
-Changed skills costs to better reflect power levels
-Removed all minimum ranges
-Increased speed from 42 to 55
-Lightning Strike targets increased from 4/6/7 to 5/6/7

	-Cooldown increased from 15s to 20s
-Son of the Storm
	-Shots changed from 3/5/10/15 to 3/6/9/12

I thought making Dianyun more barracks-support oriented would be an interesting idea for a dragon. As such, he's gained more support tools to encourage that. He also got a number of QOL changes.

-Explosive Head damage increased from 30/60/100 to 33/67/100
-Jack's Explosive Head deals explosive damage
-Haunted Blade
	-Now deals true damage
	-Damage changed from 50-90 to 20-30/45-60/70-90
	-Cooldown increased from 16/8/4 to 16s
	-Also removes armor
-Ghoul duration increased from 20s to 25s
-Nightmare damage decreased from 12/20/40/60 to 12/24/36/48 per tick
-Nightmare speed decreased from 90 to 80

Jack is mostly the same as in the base game, playstyle wise. His stats now mimic KRF before hero upgrades are applied. Haunted Blade removing armor is a nice usability bonus, and his ult now moves slower to catch more units in it. Show him a good time, eh?
