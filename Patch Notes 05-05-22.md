Patch Notes 05-05-22

Please note that these are only the changes in the most recent update, please refer to 'Full Change Log.txt' for all changes made in the mod.

[TOWERS]
-Infernal Portal nerfed
	-Teleport distance decreased from 35 nodes to 30 nodes
	-Max targets decreased from 4/6 to 3/6

-Biggarangs buffed
	-Damage increased from 28-49/36-63/44-77 to 60-100/90-150/120-200
	-Now doubly benefits from Headbang
	-Slow duration increased from 0.1s to 0.5s

Teleport was a bit strong, so it was nerfed. Biggarangs still had no reason to be bought so hopefully this is better. It now deals approximately 2.5x regular attack damage at level 1, as the animation takes that long.

[SHAOLIN TEMPLE]
-Number of monks decreased from 3 to 2
-Attack cooldown increased from 0.8s to 1.2s
-Should no longer continue to attack possessed targets
-L1 damage increased from 2-4 to 4-8
-L1 stun increased from 0.3s to 0.4s
-L2 damage increased from 5-9 to 10-18
-L2 stun increased from 0.4s to 0.53s
-L3 damage increased from 9-17 to 18-34
-L3 stun increased from 0.5s to 0.66s
-L4 damage increased from 14-26 to 28-52
-L4 stun increased from 0.6s to 0.8s
-Shaolin Monks (upgrade) replaced with Six-Star Strike
	-Deals 6 instances of 36 true damage in an area of 90 each
	-Each instance applies a stacking 1.36x damage multiplier for 0.66 seconds
	-Cooldown is 30/24/18 seconds
	-Cost is 300/225/225

This should be the final iteration on the Shaolin. Essentially, this should make them less niche - their overall stun capacity has been decreased to about 66%, but their damage is 33% higher. Furthermore, I replaced the boring and ineffective Shaolin Monks upgrade with a cooler active ability. Have fun!
