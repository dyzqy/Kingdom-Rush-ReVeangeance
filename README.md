## Instructions

1. Download the zip '[KR4.zip](https://github.com/dyzqy/Kingdom-Rush-ReVeangeance/raw/main/KR4.zip)' in the Repository
2. Unzip the downloaded folders
3. In Steam, go to **Kingdom Rush Vengeance > Properties > Local Files > Browse**
	- **Windows:** You can also open the Vengeance files in ***C:\Users\user\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Kingdom Rush Vengeance***
	- **Mac:** You can find the Vengeance files inside of **~/Library/Application Support** - You can also use this video ***https://youtu.be/3CAh0ZZQiyo*** as help
4. Copy the two unzipped folders 'KR4' and 'KR4_PC', and paste them in the Vengeance file location from step 3
5. When the popup about files with the same names as existing files comes up, select 'Replace files'

**The following files do not have to be moved or copied as they are informational only:**
- Instructions.md
- Patch Notes.md
- Patch Notes [Most recent update date].md
- Files in Non-Necessary Components

If you want to restore the original game, simply go to **Steam**, right-click **KRV**, and open Properties. From there, go to Local Files and hit Verify Integrity of Game Files. After a short download, the game will be back to its original state.
If you wish, copying the original files before adding any modded ones will also work.

If you want to edit waves yourself, I have included the formations (specific enemy groupings) used in Revengeance, in the ***Non-Necessary Components\Formations*** folder.
