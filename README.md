**Kingdom Rush: ReVengeance** (KRRV for short) is a total gameplay overhaul of ***Kingdom Rush Vengeance*** for Steam.
Almost every aspect of the game either has changes or has changes planned. It is overall a more challenging experience, meant for players who had issues with the original game's difficulty and balance.
Keep in mind that the mod isn't final, and we are open to suggestions.

## Instructions

1. Download the zip '[KR4.zip](https://github.com/dyzqy/Kingdom-Rush-ReVeangeance/raw/main/KR4.zip)' in the Repository
2. Unzip the downloaded folders
3. In Steam, go to **Kingdom Rush Vengeance > Properties > Local Files > Browse**
	- **Windows:** You can also open the Vengeance files in ***C:\Users\user\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Kingdom Rush Vengeance***
	- **Mac:** You can find the Vengeance files inside of **~/Library/Application Support** - You can also use this video ***https://youtu.be/3CAh0ZZQiyo*** as help
4. Copy the two unzipped folders 'KR4' and 'KR4_PC', and paste them in the Vengeance file location from step 3
5. When the popup about files with the same names as existing files comes up, select 'Replace files'

**The following files do not have to be moved or copied as they are informational only:**
- Instructions.md
- Patch Notes.md
- Patch Notes [Most recent update date].md
- Files in Non-Necessary Components

If you want to restore the original game, simply go to **Steam**, right-click **KRV**, and open Properties. From there, go to Local Files and hit Verify Integrity of Game Files. After a short download, the game will be back to its original state.
If you wish, copying the original files before adding any modded ones will also work.

If you want to edit waves yourself, I have included the formations (specific enemy groupings) used in Revengeance, in the ***Non-Necessary Components\Formations*** folder.


## Features



### Revamped Towers
- Most towers have been rebalanced significantly, so no tower is much stronger than any other
- Some of the most interesting changes include:
     - The Orc Shaman is now a magic-damage artillery tower
     - The Grim Cemetery is now rallyable and can have an infinite number of zombies
     - The Rotten Forest now deals true damage and has much stronger abilities

### Rebalanced Heroes
- Heroes should now conform to a more even level of balance (looking at you, Eiskalt)
- Heroes level up much faster as well, so you can play with all of them without feeling the need to grind
    - Veruk spams units like no tomorrow
    - Margosa now takes an anti-spellcaster niche
    - Tramin is a funny goblin man

### Stronger Enemies
- Enemies as a whole are much stronger in virtually every capacity
- A number of new variations on existing enemies have been added, so keep your eyes peeled

### Better Levels
- Did you dislike the slow pace of vanilla? Well fear not, most levels have been reworked to be much faster
- Heroic and iron challenges have become a lot more... interesting

### Usable Spells
- Reinforcements are now equivalent to their counterparts in previous games, meaning lower cooldowns, longer durations, and better stats
- Soul Impact is no longer Soul Tickle, this version is as good as Rain of Fire or Lightning

### Flavor and Story Adjustments
- A lot of flavor has been added to the game, chiefly in tower descriptions
- Many new characters introduced in vanilla have been replaced with a fitting counterpart from the original games
