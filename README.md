=============[KINGDOM RUSH: REVENGEANCE CHANGE LOG]=============

- L1 range increased from 300 to 335
- L2 damage increased from 7-14 to 12-16
- L2 fire rate decreased from 0.7s to 0.9s
- L2 range increased from 330 to 370
- L3 cost decreased from 190 to 180

- Crow's Nest damage increased from 1/2 to 6/12
- Crow's Nest deals true damage

**These changes generally serve to move the Shadow Archer toward a long-range generalist role among the Archers.**

### ORC WARRIORS DEN
- Rally range increased from 290 to 350
- Respawn decreased from 12s to 10s
- L1 HP decreased from 60 to 50
- L2 armor increased from 10% to 15%
- L3 armor increased from 15% to 30%
- L3 damage increased from 5-7 to 6-8
- L4 armor increased from 20% to 40%
- L4 damage increased from 9-14 to 10-15
- Bloodlust replaced with Shamanic Blessing
	- Grants 25%/50% magic resist instead of 40%/80% bonus damage

	- Still grants +20% armor
	- Damage buff increased from +5-7 to +11-11 (21-26)
	- Can be applied to 3 Orcs

	- Note: Clicking on tower for stats glitches out when fully upgraded
- Seal of Blood cost increased from 120/120 to 180/180

The Orc Warriors are now more equivalent to the basic barracks in other games, though they trade a bit of armor for increased damage. Arena Champion can also act as a "5th" upgrade tier in case of emergencies. Their magic resistance makes them a much better choice than Dark Knights against mages.

### INFERNAL MAGE
- L1 damage increased from 5-16 to 12-21
- L1 range decreased from 300 to 280
- L2 cost decreased from 180 to 160
- L2 damage increased from 16-49 to 30-50
- L2 range increased from 315 to 320

- L3 range increased from 330 to 360
- L4 damage changed from 49-146 to 79-119
- L4 range increased from 350 to 400
- Lava Fissure geyser AoE increased from 60 to 90
- Infernal Portal 
	- Cooldown decreased from 25s to 15s
	- Teleport distance increased from 15 nodes to 30 nodes
	- Max targets decreased from 4/6 to 3/6

As with the other "basic" towers, the Infernal Mage is mostly equivalent to basic mages from other games. However, it trades a slower attack rate for greater damage. 

### ROCKET RIDERS
- L1 damage increased from 7-10 to 8-14
- L1 range increased from 330 to 350
- L1-3 AoE increased from 90 to 100
- L2 damage increased from 20-29 to 22-34
- L2 cost decreased from 210 to 200
- L2 range increased from 350 to 400
- L3 cost decreased from 310 to 275
- L3 range increased from 370 to 450
- L4 damage decreased from 64-92 to 60-88
- L4 cost decreased from 370 to 350
- L4 AoE increased from 100 to 120
- L4 fire rate increased from 2.8s to 3s
- L4 range increased from 390 to 500
- Minefield
	- Cost decreased from 300/300/300 to 200/200/200
	- Cooldown decreased from 10s to 5s
	- Damage decreased from 60/125/190 to 35/70/105
	- Trigger radius/area of affect increased from 50 to 120
- Nitro Boosters
	- Cost changed from 150/150 to 200/100
	- Cooldown decreased to 15s to 9s (every 3rd attack)
	- Damage changed from 100/180 to 90/180
	- Range increased from 500 to 550
- Defective Engines 
	- Cooldown decreased from 22s to 21s (every 7th attack)
	- Damage increased from 22/32 per debris to 50/100 per debris
	- Nodes covered increased from 5 to 10
	- AoE increased from 140 to 160
	- No longer targets flying enemies

Similarly to the Shadow Archers, the Rocket Riders are supposed to fulfill the role of long-range among the artillery towers. Minefield has received much needed buffs, and so has Defective Engines. The Nitro Booster changes are more experimental as a sort of guaranteed damage skill.

### DARK KNIGHTS
- Rally range increased from 290 to 350
- Respawn increased from 8/8/8/10s to 13s
- Attack rate L1-3 increased from 1s to 1.6s
- Soldier number increased from 2 to 3
- L1 HP decreased from 100 to 80
- L1 damage increased from 2-3 to 3-4
- L1 armor increased from 40 to 50
- L2 HP decreased from 130 to 100
- L2 damage increased from 4-10 to 8-12
- L2 armor increased from 50 to 60
- L3 HP decreased from 180 to 130
- L3 damage increased from 7-20 to 15-21
- L3 armor increased from 60 to 70
- L4 cost increased from 260 to 270
- L4 HP decreased from 240 to 180
- L4 armor increased from 75 to 80
- L4 damage changed from 12-36 to 20-35
- Brutal Strike
	- Deals 60/120/180 true (bleed) damage over 3s, with a 10s cooldown
	- No longer instakills
	- Cost reduced from 280/280/280 to 220/220/220
- Armor of Thorns
	- Damage decreased from 15/30/45 to 8/16/24
	- Damage type changed to true
	- Cost increased from 150/150/150 to 200/200/200

Dark Knights now have 3 units, exciting. Their HP has been decreased to accomodate this. Attack rate has also been changed so that they deal more damage with slower attacks. Instakills on barracks are a bad idea (just look at how Sneak Attack ruined Rising Tides), unless you design around them, which really limits design freedom and skews the balance towards fodder only. Armor of Thorns now deals true damage like other versions of spiked armor in the games. 

### MELTING FURNACE
- Renamed to the Blast Furnace
- Stun removed from all levels
- Cooldown decreased from 4s to 3s
- Now deals explosive damage instead of ignoring 75% armor
- L1 cost increased from 120 to 125
- L1 range decreased from 320 to 310
- L2 cost increased from 190 to 220
- L2 range increased from 320 to 340
- L3 damage increased from 25-31 to 27-33
- L3 cost increased from 240 to 320
- L3 range increased from 320 to 370
- L4 damage increased from 41-50 to 42-50
- L4 cost increased from 300 to 400
- L4 range increased from 320 to 400
- Red Hot Coals
	- Cost increased from 140/180 to 200/200
	- Damage increased from 5/8 per tick to 5/10 per tick
	- Coal damage area increased from 40 to 80
	- Note: decal may not match effect radius
	- Range increased from 350 to 400
- Burning Fuel renamed Explosive Fuel
	- Cooldown decreased from 30s to 24s
	- Still doubles attack speed, now to 1.5s
	- Every other attack inflicts a 0.8s stun

In an effort to allocate more of the Furnace's power budget to damage, the stun was removed, in favor of faster attack speed. It also now deals explosive damage, which ignores less armor. Coals was rebalanced around being a mini-Furnace Blast, cheaper, but not as effective. Burning Fuel was mostly changed to fit in with the faster attack speed.

### SPECTRAL MAUSOLEUM
- L1 cost decreased from 110 to 80
- L1 damage increased from 5-8 to 8-13
- L1 range decreased from 350 to 300
- L2 damage increased from 13-20 to 20-31
- L2 range decreased from 350 to 325
- L3 cost increased from 170 to 180
- L3 damage increased from 26-38 to 34-52
- L3 range decreased from 350 to 325
- L4 cost increased from 230 to 240
- L4 damage increased from 48-71 to 50-72
- Gargoyle cost increased from 250/250 to 275/275
- Gargoyle damage decreased from 16-24 to 8-12
- Spectral Communion cost decreased from 300/150 to 160/80
- Possession
	- Cost increased from 200/100/100 to 300/150/150
	- No longer targets max health
	- No longer targets Ghosts or Frozen Souls

The Mausoleum takes the role of the cheap mage, with a relatively weak attack but costing significantly less. Possession was hit with the nerf bat, costing much more and no longer targeting the biggest enemy in a group.

### GOBLIRANGS
- Renamed to Boomerang Goblins
- Boomerang return damage increased from 0.5x to 1x
- L1 damage increased from 3-5 to 3-6
- L1 range decreased from 350 to 300
- L2 damage increased from 7-14 to 8-15
- L2 range decreased from 350 to 330
- L3 damage decreased from 14-26 to 15-26
- L3 range decreased from 350 to 330
- L4 cost increased from 270 to 280
- L4 damage decreased from 25-47 to 23-41
- L4 range increased from 350 to 360
- Biggarangs 
	- Damage increased from 27-49/32-60/43-71 to 60-100/90-150/120-200
	- Slow duration increased from 0.1s to 0.5s
	- Is doubly affected by Headbang's stun chance
	- Is now affected by Advanced Targeting System
- Headbang changed from a 5/10/15% chance to stun for 1.2s to a 15% chance to stun for 0.5/1/1.5s
- Headbang cost increased from 130/130/130 to 150/150/150
- Angry Bees
	- Damage increased from 120/240/345 to 120/240/360
	- Now hits flying
	- Is now affected by Advanced Targeting System

Now actually fulfilling the advertised "two for the price of one", the Boomerang Goblins have lower initial damage, but higher potential from return damage. Biggarangs and Angry Bees have only minor changes. Headbang was changed to make the lower levels feel less bad, as a 5% chance to trigger isn't much.

### BONE FLINGERS
- L1 damage increased from 2-4 to 3-4
- L2 cost decreased from 110 to 100
- L2 damage changed from 5-11 to 6-8
- L2 fire rate increased from 0.6s to 0.5s
- L3 cost decreased from 150 to 140
- L3 damage decreased from 9-20 to 8-12
- L3 fire rate increased from 0.6s to 0.4s
- L4 damage decreased from 14-34 to 9-13
- L4 fire rate increased from 0.6s to 0.3s
- Shortened attack animation
- The Walking Dead
	- Max level changed from 2 to 3
	- Cooldown changed from 16/12s to 12/16/11s
	- Skeleton HP decreased from 80 to 60
	- Skeleton Warrior HP increased from 120 to 200
	- Skeleton Warrior damage increased from 15-25 to 20-40
	- Skeleton Warrior armor increased from 0 to 30
- Got Milk cost increased from 110/110/110 to 140/140/140
- Got Milk damage decreased from +5/+5/+5 to +2/+2/+2
- Bone Golem
	- Max level increased from 1 to 2
	- Max units changed to 1/2
	- Melee damage increased from 17-41 to 25-45
	- Ranged fire rate increased from 1s to 0.6s
	- Ranged damage decreased from 17-31 to 9-18
	- Armor increased from 0% to 20%

Generally speaking, these Flingers fire faster but deal less damage. Got Milk is technically stronger but also costs more, Bone Golem is a bit more effective, and Walking Dead more closely mimics KR1 Skellies. Extra max levels help them not become useless due to not havng enough power per tower spot.

### GRIM CEMETERY
- Now has a rally point
- Generates up to 3 soldiers by default
- Enemies that die in range of the tower are resurrected as a lesser zombie, with 2/3 of the health of the rallyable zombies
	- These lesser zombies decay at 10% of their health per second and are not affected by War Rations
- Removed sideways shuffle for rallyable zombies
- Range increased from 260/260/260/330 to 350
- Attack speed decreased from 1s to 1.5s
- L1 cost increased from 70 to 80
- L1 HP decreased from 85 to 75
- L1 damage increased from 1-2 to 3-4
- L2 cost increased from 110 to 120
- L2 HP decreased from 130 to 105
- L2 damage increased from 2-4 to 5-7
- L3 cost increased from 150 to 160
- L3 HP decreased from 180 to 150
- L3 damage increased from 3-6 to 6-10
- L4 HP decreased from 240 to 210
- L4 damage increased from 4-10 to 8-13
- Cold Grip cast radius increased from 260 to 350
- Cold Grip effect radius increased from 70 to 100
- Zombie-X Muscle Gain renamed Undead Horde
	- No longer increases the HP of zombies
	- Now adds +1 rallyable zombie per level, up to 2
	- Cost decreased from 150 to 125/125
- Bloated Zombies damage changed from 15/60 magic + 27 poison to 30/60 magic + 30 poison
- Explosive Corpses
	- Still only applies to summoned zombies
	- Damage increased from 15/60 to 30/60
	- Poison changed from 27 over 3s to 15/30 over 3s
	- Damage type changed from magic to true for both initial damage and poison
	- Range decreased from 100 to 70
	- Cooldown decreased from 4s to 0s

The tower has been reworked to be much more consistent and reliable, one of its major issues in the original incarnation. It now has a small group of rallyable soldiers, but can still summon more zombies from corpses. These extra summons do have timed life though. This change in turn makes Explosive Corpses actually good. The attack speed increase makes blocking more reliable.

### ELITE HARASSERS
- Renamed to (Corrupt) Sylvan Harassers
- Rally range increased from 350 to 375
- Ranged fire rate increased from 0.9s to 1.4s
- Passive dodge chance increased from 30% to 40%
- L1 damage increased from 5-7 to 5-9
- L2 cost increased from 150 to 160

- L2 damage increased from 10-13 to 10-16
- L3 cost increased from 200 to 230
- L3 HP decreased from 180 to 170
- L3 damage decreased from 15-25 to 15-23
- L4 cost increased from 250 to 275
- L4 damage decreased from 25-35 to 20-30
- Backstab dodge gain increased from +10/+10% (50%) to +15%/+15% (70%)
- Backstab damage increased from 10-20/15-30 to 30-40/50-60
- Arrow Storm
	- Cost increased from 140/140/140 to 175/175/175
	- Cooldown decreased from 12s to 10s
	- Arrow quantity decreased from 5 to 4
	- Damage changed from 16-24/32-48/60-72 to 17-21/34-42/51-63
- Fury of the Twilight renamed to Spectral Fury

	- HP increased from 250 to 325
	- Damage decreased from 32-48 to 25-35
	- Damage type changed from physical to true
	- Duration increased from 6s to 8s

The Harassers remain the damage Barracks, though attempts were made to make the melee mode more appealing. Otherwise, a few changes were made to make them more closely mimic their Origins stats.

### ROTTEN FOREST
- Renamed to Rotten Grove
- All levels deal true damage
- No longer slows bosses
- L1 cost increased from 120 to 130
- L1 slow decreased from 20% to 15%
- L2 cost increased from 140 to 170
- L2 fire rate increased from 0.65s to 0.8s
- L2 range increased from 280 to 300
- L3 cost increased from 190 to 210
- L3 fire rate increased from 0.5s to 0.6s
- L3 range increased from 280 to 320
- L3 slow decreased from 30% to 25%
- L4 cost increased from 220 to 250
- L4 range increased from 280 to 340
- Evil Treants renamed to Tainted Treants
	- HP decreased from 260 to 120
	- Health loss decreased from 25/s to 10/s
	- Damage decreased from 16-24 to 8-12
	- Armor increased from 0% to 80%
	- Cost increased from 200/100 to 250/100
- Roots of Evil 
	- Cost increased from 160/160 to 300/300

- Mist of Despair
	- Mist of Despair cost increased from 120 to 275
	- New functionality: Enemies within the fog have a 3% chance to run in fear for 3s

Rotten Forest good??? True damage helps the tower actually have an effect, which is pretty cool. Treants now resemble their high-armor counterparts from KR1, though they still lose HP over time because otherwise they will not die. Roots of Evil is a bit closer to WotF now. Mist of Despair's new functionality is nice, and comboes well with the passive slow, active stun, and blockers.

### WICKED SISTERS
- Poison tick changed from 3 ticks over 2.4s to 5 ticks over 1.0s
- Poison cooldown decreased from 2.5s to 2s
- Poison now ignores already poisoned targets
-Stun chance increased from 40% to 100%
-Stun duration decreased from 0.8s to 0.2s
- Stun cooldown decreased from 2.5s to 0.9s
- Attack cast time decreased from 0.733s to 0.433s
- Projectile speed increased from 25 to 45
- Note: The wind-up animation cuts off due to the cast time decrease
- No longer targets first spawned, but targets closest to exit like most towers
- Rally range increased from 250 to 275
- L1 poison damage decreased from 7 to 4
- L1 stun damage decreased from 11-25 to 8-10
- L2 cost increased from 160 to 180
- L2 poison damage decreased from 17 to 9
- L2 stun damage decreased from 27-63 to 19-23
- L2 rally range increased from 275 to 300
- L3 cost increased from 200 to 260
- L3 poison damage decreased from 30 to 14
- L3 stun damage decreased from 48-112 to 34-40
- L3 rally range increased from 275 to 325
- L4 cost increased from 250 to 320
- L4 poison damage decreased from 50 to 19
- L4 stun damage decreased from 78-182 to 48-56
- L4 rally range increased from 325 to 350
- Froggification
	- Cost increased from 230/180 to 325/180
	- Cooldown increased from 22/18 to 25/20
	- Polymorph duration increased from 6s to infinite
	- Is now uninterruptible
	- Targets closest to exit instead of first spawned
	- Animation changed to fire a pink bolt
- Hex Totem now targets silenceable units
- Nimbus 4000 cost increased from 100/100 to 125/125

Wicked Sisters received a ton of changes - not necessarily to make them stronger, but to make them more playable. The cast time is no longer ridiculous, so the witches will actually hit targets before they die. The new stun mode is supposed to offer a sort of multi-target contrast to the single-target poison. Plus, the stun is pretty funny on long attack wind-up enemies like Svell Druids, which get perma-stunned. Froggification is now basically the same as the Sorc's Polymorph.

### ORC SHAMAN
᲼᲼
